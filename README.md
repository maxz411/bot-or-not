# Bot or not challenge 2026

## Project structure
This is a monorepo with js/ and python/ projects. The reason for the js project was mainly to be able to use Vercel's Ai SDK and JS's promise system to speed up the LLM calls. In the python/ project is where we try more customized models and techniques.

The project was setup in a way to be able to iterate quickly (thus the bun cli). There are both ai generated and human written ideas implemented, we just wanted to throw as much as possible and see what would stick.
